## Projects

* * * 

I've worked with microcontrollers in many different classes, such as Digital Systems Design Using Microcontrollers [ECE 4760], Embedded Systems [ECE 3140], and Intelligent Physical Systems [ECE 3400]. I've also done a range of projects from probability calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to user-centric design and user experience testing.

You can see a few individual project pages I wanted to highlight below!
