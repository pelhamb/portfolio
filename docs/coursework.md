## Coursework

* * * 

I've taken classes covering a wide range of subjects - as you might have seen in my intro, I feel as if I embody my major's slogan, "ECEs can do everything!" Some of my favorite classes have been: Adult Psychopathology, where we learned about a wide range of mental illnesses while reading Freud and Hamlet; any and all of my microcontrollers classes, some of which are discussed in the [Projects](projects.html) section; Electromagnetic Waves, which challenged me beyond measure with novel physics concepts, calculations, and diagrams, including the dreaded Smith Chart; and finally, my probability courses, which taught me to think deeply about how variables and state systems like Markov chains function.
