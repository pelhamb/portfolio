Welcome to Pelham's website!

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, currently studying at Cornell University. This website is meant to show off my projects, most of which have to do  with microcontrollers, digital signal processing, music, or all of the above. 

I'm still working on this website, so please pardon the appearance of any incomplete pages.

 My senior year of college, I was elected a team captain of the Cornell Men's Varsity Track & Field team.
