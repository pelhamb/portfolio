# Welcome to Pelham's website!

* * * 

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, currently studying at Cornell University. This website is  meant to to show off my projects, most of which have to do  with microcontrollers, digital signal processing, music, or all of the above. 

I'm still working on this website, so please pardon the appearance of any incomplete pages.
