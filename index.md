Welcome to Pelham's website!

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, currently studying at Cornell University. This website is meant to show off my projects and give you a sense of my personality. I've worked with microcontrollers, digital signal processing, music, probability, and many other disciplines, so if you're seeking a multitalented hire please reach out through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pelham-bergesen-87292a211/) so we can chat!

I'm still working on this website, so please pardon the appearance of any incomplete pages.
